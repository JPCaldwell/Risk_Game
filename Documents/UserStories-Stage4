WEEK 4 USER STORIES

Any remaining user stories from earlier weeks, plus:

Graphical User Interface:

Build a functional graphical user interface which lets users play the game.

The mode of interaction is up to you (as long as it is graphical/event driven).
In other words, moving students can be done by clicking on a student and then
clicking on the department to which they should move, or by clicking and dragging
a student from one department to another.

All information relevant to being able to play the game must be conveyed through 
the UI.  For example, each player could be associated with a unique color - that
color could then be used to indicate to the chair of departments and students, as
well as the dean of schools.  Another piece of information that must be displayed
is whose turn it is currently.

The user interface (or more properly, the underlying game model) must enforce game
rules (e.g. you can only move your own students, not the students belonging to 
another chair).

SUBMISSION: In order for the TAs to give you some feedback on what you've
accomplished we ask that each team submit what they have, no later than a full
48 hours prior to their next recitation (i.e. if you have recitation on Tuesday
at 11:00 AM you should submit the current state of your project by Sunday at
11:00 AM).  Do this for each weekly submission from here on in.

Also, be sure that only one team member makes a submission each week, and 
make sure that they list ALL team members as partners when making the 
submission.
 
PIAZZA - Ask general project questions in Piazza.  Your customer (me!) is
waiting for questions, and has already answered several.  Be sure to tag
project questions with the 'project' tag.
